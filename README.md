# Arduino-Data-logger-with-RTC-and-SD-card
This code is for an Arduino pro-mini connected to:
  - A real time clock (RTC) module (I2C interface)
  - A SD card reader (with SPI interface)
  - an OLED display (I2C interface)
The systems monitors the changes of state of an digital pin, and writes the tie and dates of each change to the SD card.
